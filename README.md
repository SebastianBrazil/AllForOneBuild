1/25/24: Created the html and css for most of the website, still needs the JS logic and an API to connect to. 1/26/24 pt1, 2:00 pm: Finished the html/css and added the JS IDs. 1/26/24 pt2, 4:00 pm: Connected JS to API, added button events. Done.

Peer Review: (Adrian Martinez, 1 / 26 / 2024, 4:21 PM)<br>
Code runs and functions as expected, responsiveness also works, and endpoints return exact data as need for the various challenges built, only issue is having to load up the endpoint api each time alongside the website for the All For One to work and return the required data. Other than that, good job!
